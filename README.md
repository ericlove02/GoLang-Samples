# GoLang-Samples

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project  
I created these simple GoLang scripts when I was interviewing with Staking Rewards. The company uses GoLang to collect market data from a variety of sources, whether its API's or webscraping. The main example of this can be found in [api-test.go](https://github.com/ericlove02/GoLang-Samples/blob/main/api-test.go). This was my first time using Go. I ultimately did not work with Staking Rewards due to the time difference.
